## Problem Statement

### Section Title
**Saving recipes isn't cooking**

### Body
You've got hundreds of saved recipes scattered across Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, and recipe blogs. But when it's time to plan dinner, you're still staring at the fridge asking "What should we eat?"

The problem isn't finding recipes. It's committing to cooking them.

## Solution Section

### Section Title
**Menu-first meal planning**

### Body
Cooked flips the script. Instead of collecting recipes you might cook someday, you build a menu of meals you're actually going to make this week.

1. **Import recipes** from TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, or any recipe website
2. **Build your menu** by selecting what you'll cook this week
3. **Generate your grocery list** automatically from your menu
4. **Cook and track** your progress throughout the week
