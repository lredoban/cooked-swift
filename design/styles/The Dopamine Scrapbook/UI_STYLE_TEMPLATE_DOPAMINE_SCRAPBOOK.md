# UI Style Guide: The Dopamine Scrapbook (Cooked App)

> **Philosophy:** This style leans into "Chaotic Maximalism" and "Anti-Design." It rejects the polished, sterile look of traditional apps in favor of raw, high-energy visuals that feel like a creator’s social feed. It treats the interface as an entertainment hub, not just a tool.

## 🎨 Visual Identity

### Core Philosophy: "Anti-Design Utility"
We are rejecting the sterile, "corporate minimalist" aesthetic. The app should feel like a digital collage—part TikTok feed, part physical scrapbook.

### 🌑 Theme: Dark Mode Only
Gen Z rarely uses light mode for media consumption.
* **Background:** Deep Black (#000000)
* **Surface:** Grainy Dark Gray (#121212)
* **Accents:** "Electric" High-Contrast Palette

| Color | Hex | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acid Green** | #CCFF00 | Primary CTAs, Success States, Checkboxes |
| **Hyper-Pink** | #FF007F | Badges, Progress Bars, Selection Borders |
| **Cyber Yellow** | #FFF01F | Warning, Highlights, Secondary Icons |

## 🔡 Typography

We use a "Mixed Media" approach. Headers should feel like they were cut out of a magazine, while body text remains legible but brutalist.

1.  **Headers (The Ransom Note):** [**Syne (Extra Bold)**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Syne) - Used for screen titles and recipe names.
2.  **Sub-headers (The Brutalist):** [**Space Grotesk**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Grotesk) - Used for section headers and button text.
3.  **Body Text:** [**Inter**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) - Used for ingredients and instructions for maximum legibility.

## 🧩 Component Styling

### 1. The "Scrapbook" Recipe Card
* **Media:** Video-First Backgrounds. The background is a looping, muted video of the food (e.g., cheese bubbling).
* **Elements:** "Dopamine Decor." Use stickers, grainy gradients, and collage-style image layering.
* **Overlays:** Recipe titles use a "tape" background (a black box with 80% opacity) to mimic a label maker.

### 2. Interaction & Feedback ("Juicy")
* **Feedback:** Every tap triggers a micro-animation (e.g., confetti explodes when you save a recipe).
* **Navigation:** Gesture-based. No "Back" buttons; users swipe everything away.

### 3. Navigation Bar
* **Style:** Floating "Island" at the bottom with a frosted glass (blur) effect.
* **Icons:** Thick-stroke neon icons that "glow" when active.

## 🖼️ Screen Inventory Adaptations

### 1. Menu Tab (The Planning Hub)
* **Empty State:** Instead of a simple icon, use a grainy, high-contrast collage of a kitchen in "Acid Green" duotone.
* **Progress Bar:** A thick "Hyper-Pink" neon tube that fills up with a glowing gradient as you cook.

### 2. Recipe Detail (The Reading View)
* **Hero Image:** Uses a "sticker" treatment where the main food item is cut out from its background and layered over a Grainy Gradient.
* **Steps:** Numbering is massive (72pt Syne) and semi-transparent behind the text.
